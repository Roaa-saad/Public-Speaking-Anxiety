##  Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** – for data exploration and aggregation using queries (`SELECT`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `COUNT`, `AVG`).  
- **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  
- **Power BI** – for building interactive dashboards and storytelling.
